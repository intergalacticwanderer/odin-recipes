    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 (15-oz.) cans black beans, rinsed and drained </li>
            <li> 8 tostadas </li>
            <li> 2 c. shredded pepper jack  </li>
            <li>Avocado, sliced</li>
            <li>Hot sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a small saucepan over medium heat, add beans and 1 cup of water. Bring to a simmer and let simmer until beans are warmed through, about 10 minutes. Smash with a wooden spoon until most of the beans are smashed with some whole remaining. Add more water as needed to help create a smoother consistency. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place tostadas on a large baking sheet and sprinkle cheese evenly over each. Bake until cheese is melty, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Top tostadas with beans, avocado slices, and hot sauce.</li>
        </ol>
