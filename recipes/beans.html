    <h1>Spicy Beans</h1>
        <img src="./../images/beans.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kidney beans are usually the least favourite beans, not sure why really as when cooked properly are so delicious! This is another cupboard hero recipe which only required few staple ingredients and some spices to create the most flavoursome dish! I served the beans with some paprika panfried peppers but you can totally just have them with some rice or with some baked potatoes. The bean are also perfect for freezing so you can double the quantities if you are planning some meal prepping for the week.</p>
        <p>Serves 2-3 people</p>
